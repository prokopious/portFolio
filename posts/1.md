I believe in using my own products, so I made this cookware shop for testing purposes to better help clients run their own businesses. It was made using Next.js and Stripe Checkout. While this site was made with Stripe Checkout and Next.js, I have made similar sites with Gatsby and the Stripe Elements library, which is more customizable. Buy yourself a rolling pin today!
